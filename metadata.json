Systems Manager works with managed instances: Amazon EC2 instances, or servers and virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises environment that are configured for Systems Manager.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInclude the default recipe.\n\n```\ninclude_recipe 'ssm_agent::default'\n```\n\nAdditionally, the EC2 instance running the service will require specific IAM permissions which may be provided via [Managed Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/systems-manager-access.html#sysman-configuring-access-policies). However, it's recommended to create a custom IAM policy due to how insecure the default managed policy seems to be.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* [github:amazon-ssm-agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent)\n",
